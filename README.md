# Vesl
This project is a bash script that makes it easy to
manage your docker containers for local CMS (Drupal, 
Wordpress, etc) development.

Coming soon: [vesl.sh](http://vesl.sh)

## Getting started
To test this project out locally you can clone it
and create a symlink in your path.

On Ubuntu that would look something like this:
(make sure you have git and docker already installed)
```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/Jantcu/vesl.git
sudo ln -s ~/Downloads/vesl/vesl /usr/local/bin/vesl
```

If you want to use this project ongoing, you might want to 
move the script somewhere besides your Downloads folder
where it's likely to get deleted.
